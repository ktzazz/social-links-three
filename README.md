## My process

I started with the box that contains the flexboxes, I found difficult to center the item's text, since I didn't remember that you can put a flexbox inside another flexbox, but after I made my research I could overcome the challenge and everything fall into place. 
I have to keep practicing so I'ld be able to finish little projects like this in no time. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
